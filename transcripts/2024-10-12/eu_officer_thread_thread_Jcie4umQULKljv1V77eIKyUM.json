These stakeholders might have competing interests or objectives\u301012:12\u2020source\u3011 .\n\n3. **Financial Complications**: Navigating the financial protocols, especially due to the \"Delegated Authority\" agreement between the EU and Irish Aid, could present bureaucratic challenges\u2014and delays could affect project timelines\u301012:17\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Cultural and Social Barriers**: You might face challenges related to gender equality and community buy-in, as you will need to promote EU values like gender equality while working with local customs and societal norms\u301012:15\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. **Coordination with Multiple Parties**: You will need to liaise closely with UNDP, Irish Aid, and other local bodies, which can be complex due to the overlapping roles and differing operational procedures\u301012:15\u2020source\u3011\u301012:13\u2020source\u3011.\n\n6. **Political Sensitivities**: The project is politically sensitive, so missteps could have broader implications for your career and the overall success of the project\u301012:13\u2020source\u3011.\n\nBy anticipating these challenges, you can better strategize your actions and align them with your objectives while navigating the intricacies of rural development work in East Timor.",
