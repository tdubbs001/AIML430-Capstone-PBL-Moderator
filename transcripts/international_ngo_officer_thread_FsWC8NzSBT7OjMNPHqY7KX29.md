User: Dear European Union Programme Officer,  it was a pleasure to finally meet you at the Steering Committee meeting. I hope that we all will make progress on the project. It was brought to my attention that an annual report from my side is required by the BU. I just wanted to ask you about information about the required format for this report to avoid any kind of misunderstanding or other difficulties.  Thank you very much and all the best, iNGO
Assistant: Regarding the required format for the annual report you need to submit, details specific to the format are not explicitly mentioned in the available documents. However, as the European Union Programme Officer, you are responsible for providing detailed financial reports annually【4:1†source】. It would be advisable to follow the standard EU report format, which typically includes sections on financial expenditures, project progress, challenges encountered, and future plans.

To avoid any misunderstandings or difficulties, I recommend reaching out to your direct contacts in the EU or consulting any official EU documents you have access to for specific formatting guidelines. If you need further assistance or clarification, you can also utilize the support channels such as "Ask an Expert" lifeline available in the simulation【4:16†source】.
