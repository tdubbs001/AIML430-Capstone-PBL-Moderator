Assistant (2024-10-17 06:17:34): As an international NGO program officer with Oxfam GB, your main role in the "Bemori – Water for Life" simulation is to get water systems up and running in a minimum of 8 out of 10 villages, with a particular focus on the Bemori Pilot scheme. In the process, you are tasked with building local capacity【4:0†source】.

Your responsibilities include supporting the development of a clear planning framework for the Rural Village Water Scheme, building the capacity of local government and NGO counterparts, managing equipment and staff budgets, and reporting progress monthly【4:0†source】.

Your private objective is to gain experience, helping poor people in developing countries, and ultimately securing a UN job with status and good pay【4:0†source】.

In this simulation, it's critical for you to coordinate with various stakeholders such as the District Water Engineer, local NGO, and other international partners to ensure the successful implementation of water systems, while navigating the challenges that can arise from logistical, political, and social complexities【4:0†source】.
